<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project is based on the Iris Dataset and covers the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>Basic summary and background info on the Iris Dataset</li>
<li>Analysis of the dataset using Python and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Through the course of my analysis, I used some of these libraries to visualize the Iris data to see what interesting aspects I could identify.</li></ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>I investigated the dataset using Python version 3.6.3. I used Pandas for the sheer convenience of importing the dataset and also NUmPy and Matplotlib as I mentioned above. I also used a Jupyter Notebook for my investigation.</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>From my investigations I was able to observe the following:</p>
<ul><li>The Iris Setosa is typically the smallest species in terms of petal width, petal length, and sepal length. However, the sepal width of the Iris Setosa is typically larger than the Iris Versicolor or the Iris Virginica.</li>
<li>Looking at the petal width distribution, we can see that the Iris Setosa's petal width is significantly smaller than the Iris Versicol or Iris Virginica. If you see an Iris flower with a petal width of less than 0.6 cm it is almost certainly an Iris Setosa.</li>
<li>An Iris flower with a petal length of over 5cm is almost certainly an Iris Virginica.</li>
<li>Any attempt to identify an Iris flower by sepal width will run into difficulty because distributions for all 3 species are clustered around the 3cm mark.</li>
